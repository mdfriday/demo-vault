## Overview

Atelier UI provides multiple design skills for different aesthetics:

### editorial-designer
Brings the refined aesthetic of fashion editorials and magazine layouts to digital product design. Interfaces feel curated, confident, and intentional.

### apple-ui-designer
Applies iOS Human Interface Guidelines and modern Apple design language. Interfaces feel native, calm, and inevitable — like first-party Apple apps.

### ios-glass-ui-designer
Applies iOS material system with tasteful glass effects (translucency, blur, depth). Glass is used as a tool for hierarchy and focus — not as decoration. Perfect for modern iOS interfaces that need layered depth without overdoing glassmorphism.

## Design Examples

### Editorial Designer

![Editorial Design Example](images/image.jpg)

This example showcases a fashion e-commerce app designed with editorial principles:

- **Bold Typography** — "GET READY TO SLAY IN STYLE" demonstrates confident, editorial-style headlines
- **Dark & Light Contrast** — Strategic use of dark cards against light backgrounds creates visual depth
- **Accent Color Strategy** — Yellow serves as a cohesive accent throughout, from clothing imagery to UI elements
- **Minimal UI Chrome** — Clean buttons, subtle icons, and text-based navigation reduce visual noise
- **Card-Based Layout** — Rounded corners and generous padding create a premium, tactile feel
- **Whitespace as Design** — Intentional breathing room guides the eye and elevates content

### Apple UI Designer

![Apple Music UX Case Study - Dock](images/apple.png)

This Apple Music "Now Playing" UX case study demonstrates Apple-native design principles:

- **Translucency & Depth** — Frosted glass dock and sheets create layered visual hierarchy
- **Progressive Disclosure** — Information reveals contextually through swipe-up dock interaction
- **System-like Components** — Native bottom sheets, standard iOS control layouts
- **Touch Target Clarity** — Large, comfortable hit areas for playback controls
- **Color Restraint** — Accent color (pink) used sparingly, letting content breathe
- **Gesture-first Design** — Swipe-up dock, drag-to-dismiss sheets feel native to iOS

### iOS Glass UI Designer

![iOS Glass UI - Widgets](images/glass-ui.webp)

This iOS home screen demonstrates the glass material system in action:

- **Material Hierarchy** — Different blur/opacity levels based on content needs (weather vs reminders vs controls)
- **Background Adaptation** — Glass intensity scales with background complexity
- **Legibility First** — Text remains clear despite translucency
- **Restraint** — Glass only where it aids hierarchy, not everywhere
- **Depth Without Borders** — Separation achieved through material, not outlines
- **System Consistency** — All glass surfaces feel unified and native

## Design Principles

- **Typography-first** — Large, expressive headlines with strong visual hierarchy
- **Monochrome foundation** — White, off-white, black, charcoal, beige
- **Editorial tension** — Intentional asymmetry, broken grids, generous whitespace
- **Minimal affordances** — Flat buttons, text-based actions, trust user intuition
- **Subtle motion** — Opacity, translate, scale ≤ 1.05. No bounce or spring.
